# Calci-
Lexical analyser and parser designed for a new language that accommodates features of a calculator with added highlights of array addition and multiplication.

The language has following features: 

a) Basic methods to calculate i.e. evaluation of the whole mathematical expression entered. 
b) In built trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential and basic calculation functions. 
c) Commands to print literals and variables and take variables as input. 
d) Can declare and initialize variables and even arrays. (Integers and floating point data type). 
e) Basic input and output commands. 
f) Basic flow of control statements (if -else) 
g) Looping statements (for and while) 
h) Comments 

Rules followed while constructing the syntax of the language: 
a)	Brackets must be in pairs. 
b)	Binary operators must have two operands respectively. 
c)	Special case of –sign to be considered as it is both unary and binary operator. 
d)	One number can have only one decimal. 
e)	Each in built function can have more than one form, so it has to be checked whether the parameters are properly passed or not. 
f)	Further, checking the validity of identifiers, keywords and statements. 
g)	Each statement or command must end with delimiter ‘;’  
h)	Comments are started by ‘#’ sign. 
i)	Along with these rules, show (for printing output) and input (for taking input from users) statements should also be written in proper syntax. 
j)	There should not be type mismatch between destination variable and expression.
k)	If-else statement should always come in pairs. (no single if)
l)	Rules for loops, conditional statements, function calls and assignment are described in the grammar.
